The methods that `DAISIEprep` provides to run ancestral state
reconstruction (ASR) are parsimony and the Markov model (Mk) using
functionality from the R package `castor`. These are provided as
standard in the `DAISIEprep::add_asr_node_states()` function to easily
allow a user to run a reconstruction to be later used by the `asr`
algorithm in the `extract_island_species()` function (this being the
central function of the `DAISIEprep` package). The parsimony and the Mk
model provide simple models that have been widely used in evolutionary
biology since their development. For details on the parsimony method see
documentation for `castor::asr_max_parsimony()` and for details on the
Mk model see documentation for `castor::asr_mk_model()`.

Here we show the same example as in the Tutorial vignette to show how
both methods are implemented:

```{r, add_asr_node_state example}
set.seed(
  1,
  kind = "Mersenne-Twister",
  normal.kind = "Inversion",
  sample.kind = "Rejection"
)
phylo <- ape::rcoal(10)

phylo$tip.label <- c("bird_a", "bird_b", "bird_c", "bird_d", "bird_e", "bird_f",
                     "bird_g", "bird_h", "bird_i", "bird_j")

phylo <- phylobase::phylo4(phylo)

endemicity_status <- sample(
  x = c("not_present", "endemic", "nonendemic"), 
  size = length(phylobase::tipLabels(phylo)), 
  replace = TRUE,
  prob = c(0.6, 0.2, 0.2)
)

phylod <- phylobase::phylo4d(phylo, as.data.frame(endemicity_status))

# reconstruction using parsimony
phylod_parsimony <- add_asr_node_states(
  phylod = phylod, 
  asr_method = "parsimony")

# reconstruction using Mk model
phylod_parsimony <- add_asr_node_states(
  phylod = phylod, 
  asr_method = "parsimony"
)
```

For details on the internal workings of the `add_asr_node_states()`
function see appendix at the bottom of this article.

However, there are many models developed for the reconstruction of
states (traits) on a phylogenetic tree and thus it may be more
appropriate to use a different type of model for the empirical group
being studied. Just as R is developed to allow for packages to [extend
the
language](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html),
`DAISIEprep` is designed to allow each extension of ASR methods for
incorporation with key functions (e.g. `extract_island_species()`).

Here we give examples of three packages that can be used an extensions:
`diversitree`, `BioGeoBEARS` and `corHMM`.

`diversitree` is a packages containing a suite of State Speciation and
Extinction (SSE) model which can reconstruct ancestral states under a
model in which the rates of speciation, extinction and transition
between states all influence the reconstruction. These models prevent
the bias of having many species in a state because of high speciation
but a model, such as the Mk model, assumes it is due to high transition
rates into that state (see Maddison, 2006). The example we give uses the
MuSSE model with a three states (island endemic, island non-endemic and
not present on the island), but other SSE models in `diversitree` can be
applied in the same manner.

`BioGeoBEARS` is a widely used package that includes the DEC and DEC+J
models of biogeographic reconstruction. Therefore, it may be that people
familiar with these models want to apply them for extracting island
colonisations for DAISIE.

Lastly, `corHMM` is a package that implements a hidden markov model of
evolution, similar to the Mk model, but can better account for rate
heterogeneity by introducing hidden states into the model. Each model
can be argued for or against; with the choice influenced by the
taxonomic group being studied.

## Introduction

### ASR with DAISIE?

Why ASR with other models? Users may want to model the biogeographic
process with processes not captured by DAISIE, for example the existence
of more areas than mainland + island (e.g., an archipelago). Or some
processes left out by DAISIE, like back-colonisation from the island to
mainland.

Ultimately, DAISIE will only consider island biota for analysis of the
diversification process on the island, but interactions between mainland
and island may be deemed relevant for constituting the island biota.

## Example data

We consider the following randomly generated phylogeny and tip data:

```{r, sample_tree, include=FALSE}
set.seed(
  2,
  kind = "Mersenne-Twister",
  normal.kind = "Inversion",
  sample.kind = "Rejection"
)
phylo <- ape::rcoal(20)

phylo$tip.label <- paste0("bird_", letters[1:20])

phylo <- phylobase::phylo4(phylo)

endemicity_status <- sample(
  x = c("not_present", "endemic", "nonendemic"), 
  size = length(phylobase::tipLabels(phylo)), 
  replace = TRUE,
  prob = c(0.45, 0.45, 0.1)
)

phylod <- phylobase::phylo4d(phylo, as.data.frame(endemicity_status))

# Need the outside clade to be an outgroup
phylod@data$endemicity_status[17] <- "not_present"

plot_phylod(phylod)
```

## DEC+J

As a first example, we consider the popular DEC
(Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis) model [@ree_maximum_2008] with
founder-event speciation (DEC+J, @matzke_probabilistic_2013),
implemented in R in the **biogeobears** package [@biogeobears].

```{r, load_biogeobears}
require(BioGeoBEARS)
```

BioGeoBEARS revolves around an object, `BioGeoBEARS_run`, which stores
input data, the structure of the model to optimise, and control
parameters for optimisation.

```{r}
# Default structure of the BioGeoBEARS object
bgb_run <- define_BioGeoBEARS_run()
bgb_run
```

Many elements of this list are only relevant for advanced options of the
model and can be ignored if these features are not used. For example,
BioGeoBEARS allow explicit modelling of the connectivity between areas
and time-dependent availability of the areas. In this example, we focus
on a simple dispersal scenario between two areas (mainland and island),
so these elements can be ignored. We direct the interested user to the
[relevant tutorial](http://phylo.wikidot.com/biogeobears#toc17) on the
BioGeoBEARS website.

BioGeoBEARS expects at least two inputs, the phylogeny and the
biogeographic data, a matrix of tip states. Both must be supplied as
paths to files which will be read when the model is run.

The tree can be supplied in Newick or Nexus format, as a text file.

```{r biogeobears_tree_input}
path_to_phylo <- "../inst/extending_asr/biogeobears_ex_phylo.txt"
phylo <- as(phylod, "phylo")
ape::write.tree(phylo, file = path_to_phylo)

bgb_run$trfn <- path_to_phylo
```

Tip data must be supplied as a text file specifying presence/absence of
every tip in each area, in the format used by the
[PHYLIP](https://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html) sofware
suite. We report the full specifications from the
[BioGeoBEARS](http://phylo.wikidot.com/biogeobears#script) tutorial

```

# Geography file
# Notes:
# 1. This is a PHYLIP-formatted file. This means that in the 
#    first line, 
#    - the 1st number equals the number of rows (species)
#    - the 2nd number equals the number of columns (number of areas)
#    - after a tab, put the areas in parentheses, with spaces: (A B C D)
#
# 1.5. Example first line:
#    10    4    (A B C D)
# 
# 2. The second line, and subsequent lines:

#    speciesB    0111
#    speciesC    0001
#         ...
# 
# 2.5a. This means a TAB between the species name and the area 0/1s
# 2.5b. This also means NO SPACE AND NO TAB between the area 0/1s.
# 
# 3. See example files at:
#    http://phylo.wikidot.com/biogeobears#files

# 4. Make you understand what a PLAIN-TEXT EDITOR is:
#    http://phylo.wikidot.com/biogeobears#texteditors
#
# 3. The PHYLIP format is the same format used for C++ LAGRANGE geography files.
#
# 4. All names in the geography file must match names in the phylogeny file.
#
# 5. DON'T USE SPACES IN SPECIES NAMES, USE E.G. "_"
#
# 6. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) should ideally be phylogenetic lineages, 
#    i.e. genetically isolated populations.  These may or may not be identical 
#    with species.  You would NOT want to just use specimens, as each specimen 
#    automatically can only live in 1 area, which will typically favor DEC+J 
#    models.  This is fine if the species/lineages really do live in single areas,
#    but you wouldn't want to assume this without thinking about it at least. 
#    In summary, you should collapse multiple specimens into species/lineages if 
#    data indicates they are the same genetic population.

```

For convenience, we have included a function that writes this file from
a `phylod` object for the simple mainland-island case.

```{r biogeobears_geo_input}
path_to_biogeo <- "../inst/extending_asr/biogeobears_ex_biogeo.txt"
write_phylip_biogeo_file(phylod, path_to_biogeo)
BioGeoBEARS::getranges_from_LagrangePHYLIP(path_to_biogeo)
bgb_run$geogfn <- path_to_biogeo
```

While we were at it, we have nested this function in
`write_biogeobears_input()`, to prepare both this file and the Newick
file above in one command

```{r, write_biogeobears_input}
path_to_phylo <- "../inst/extending_asr/biogeobears_ex_phylo.txt"
path_to_biogeo <- "../inst/extending_asr/biogeobears_ex_biogeo.txt"
write_biogeobears_input(phylod, path_to_phylo, path_to_biogeo)

bgb_run$trfn <- path_to_phylo
bgb_run$geogfn <- path_to_biogeo
```

The structure of the model is contained in `BioGeoBEARS_model_object`.
This is simply a table that contains the status (fixed or free), values
(initial, min/max boundaries and estimated value if free) and
documentation of each parameter of the supermodel.

```{r}
bgb_run$BioGeoBEARS_model_object
```

BioGeoBEARS is indeed built as a supermodel which parameters can be
turned on or off to reproduce biogeographic models like DEC, DIVA,
BayArea and/or expand them.

See Fig. 1 in @matzke_probabilistic_2013 for an overview of the
supermodel and parameters:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("http://phylo.wdfiles.com/local--files/biogeobears/BioGeoBEARS_supermodel.png")
# do we need to ask for authorisation to reproduce this figure?
```

Note that by default, all parameters but *d* and *e* are turned off
(i.e., fixed and set to a value such that they cause no effect). That
is, by default, `BioGeoBEARS_model_object` specifies the DEC model.

For this example, we simply modify the model to make *j* a free
parameter, and thus turn the model into DEC+J.

```{r, make_dec_j}
# DEC -> DEC+J
bgb_run$BioGeoBEARS_model_object@params_table$desc[9] <- "free"
bgb_run$BioGeoBEARS_model_object@params_table$init[9] <- 0.01 # same value as d, e
```

Some further controls:

```{r, other_biogeobears_controls}
bgb_run$num_cores_to_use <- 1 # no default value on this one
bgb_run$print_optim <- FALSE # for the sake onf the vignette
```

Once everything is set up, it's a good idea to check that the input
complies to the format expected by BioGeoBEARS with the provided
function. Then, we're ready to run the optimisation:

```{r, run_biogeobears}
BioGeoBEARS::check_BioGeoBEARS_run(bgb_run)
res <- BioGeoBEARS::bears_optim_run(bgb_run)
```

We do get a warning, but
[apparently](http://phylo.wikidot.com/biogeobears-warnings-to-ignore-mostly#unused_control_arguments)
this can be ignored.

Marginal probabilities for the ancestral states appear to be found in
element `$ML_marginal_prob_each_state_at_branch_top_AT_node` of the
output (from what I infer from the code of the [plotting function
code](https://github.com/nmatzke/BioGeoBEARS/blob/7b16e5263e91389d8e16b7bead4437d39b8be5bc/R/BioGeoBEARS_plots_v1.R#L432)).
Columns respectively correspond to the posterior probability of the node
being present in the first area only (here, mainland, i.e. not present),
second area only (island, endemic), or both areas (widespread state,
nonendemic). Rows correspond to nodes (including tips!) and their order
is the same as in the tree object *read from the input Newick file*,
which may differ from the original tree. To identify the probability
associated to each node we need to match the rows with the corresponding
tip labels.

```{r, extract_decj_asr}
# Extract probabilities
asr_likelihoods <- res$ML_marginal_prob_each_state_at_branch_top_AT_node[,-1]
# Need to find which tip label matches each row
tree <- ape::read.tree(res$inputs$trfn)
tip_labels <- tree$tip.label
node_labels <- tree$node.label
if (is.null(node_labels)) node_labels <- rep(NA, length(tip_labels) - 1)
asr_df <- data.frame(
  labels = c(tip_labels, node_labels),
  not_present_prob = asr_likelihoods[,1],
  endemic_prob = asr_likelihoods[,2],
  nondendemic_prob = asr_likelihoods[,3]
)
head(asr_df)
tail(asr_df)
```

The code above has been wrapped in a utility function,
`extract_biogeobears_ancestral_states_probs()`.

```{r, extract_decj_asr2}
asr_df <- extract_biogeobears_ancestral_states_probs(res)
```

The last step before extracting the island community from the tree is to
rule which state each node is in from the probabilities. We provide a
convenient function to do this from the output of the previous function:

```{r, sample_biogeobears_states}
endemicity_status <- select_endemicity_status(asr_df, method = "max")
```

By default, (`method = "max"`), we simply select the state with the
highest probability (preferring the last in the event of a tie).
`method` can also be set to `"random"` to sample states randomly based
on the probabilities, which can be of use if one desires to explore the
sensibility of downstream DAISIE analyses to the ancestral state
reconstruction.

Finally, we recreate the data format expected by
`extract_island_species()` (one state column `endemicity_status` for
tips, one state column `island_status` for internal nodes) and add it
back to the tree data with `phylobase`'s `phylo4d` class.

```{r, order_biogeobears_asr}
# Add endemicity data
nb_tips <- ape::Ntip(tree)
asr_df$label <- NULL # drop label
asr_df$endemicity_status <- rep(NA, nrow(asr_df))
asr_df$endemicity_status[1:nb_tips] <- endemicity_status[1:nb_tips] 
asr_df$island_status <- rep(NA, nrow(asr_df))
asr_df$island_status[(nb_tips + 1):nrow(asr_df)] <- endemicity_status[(nb_tips + 1):nrow(asr_df)] 

# Rebuild phylod with ancestral states
phylod <- phylobase::phylo4d(tree, all.data = asr_df)
plot_phylod(phylod)
```

Voilà!

```{r, extract_species_decj}
island_clades <- DAISIEprep::extract_island_species(
  phylod = phylod,
  extraction_method = "asr"
)
island_clades@island_tbl$species
island_clades@island_tbl$branching_times
```

## MuSSE

SSE-class models explicitly model the inter-dependency between the
evolution of a set of traits and evolutionary rates (speciation and
extinction). When traits are set to represent geographic areas, such
models can be used to model range evolution. For a mainland-island
system, we could model the endemicity status as a ternary trait:
endemic, non-endemic, or not present on the island.

Discrete-trait models with more than two states are modelled with MuSSE,
which is implemented in package `diversitree`.

To make the example straightforward and avoid non-convergence issues, we use a tree simulated directly with MuSSE as an example, with
three states (mainland/island/both, or not present/endemic/nonendemic)
and arbitrary parameter values:

```{r, simulate_musse_input}
# Simulate a tree under a MuSSE model,
# with arbitrary initial parameter values
pars <- c(
  # lambda1 lambda2 lambda3
  0.2, 0.2, 0.2,
  # mu1 mu2 mu3
  0.02, 0.02, 0.02,
  # q12 q13 q21 q23 q31 q32
  0,  0.1,  0, 0,  0.1, 0.1
)
set.seed(4)
phylo <- diversitree::trees(
  pars,
  type = "musse",
  max.taxa = 20,
  max.t = Inf,
  x0 = 1
)[[1]]

# DAISIEprep requires binomial names
ntips <- ape::Ntip(phylo)
bird_names <- paste0("bird_", letters[1:ntips])
phylo$tip.label <- bird_names
names(phylo$tip.state) <- bird_names

# DAISIEprep requires a mainland outgroup
outgroup_clade <- c("bird_h", "bird_i", "bird_l", "bird_k", "bird_r", "bird_q")
phylo$tip.state[phylo$tip.label %in% outgroup_clade] <- 1 # not_present
```

The output phylogenetic trees come with simulated states attached at the
tips:

```{r, show_musse_sim_states}
phylo$tip.state
```

Because we're going to switch back and forth between those single-digit
states and the three endemicity status used by `DAISIEprep`, we have
included functions to switch easily between the two:

```{r, musse_states_to_endemic}
endemicity_status <- sse_states_to_endemicity(phylo$tip.state, sse_model = "musse")
phylod <- phylobase::phylo4d(phylo, as.data.frame(endemicity_status))
plot_phylod(phylod)
```

ASR with `diversitree` is done in three steps. The model structure is
first specified to create a likelihood function; then parameters are
optimised for this function; and finally the probabilities of states of
the internal nodes are determined with the resulting maximum-likelihood
model.

```{r, create_musse_lik}
states <- get_sse_tip_states(phylod, sse_model = "musse")
states # note that states must be named after tips
tree <- as(phylod, "phylo")

# Create likelihood function
lik_musse <- diversitree::make.musse(
  tree = tree, 
  states = states, 
  k = 3
)
lik_musse
```

```{r, fit_musse}
fit_musse <- diversitree::find.mle(func = lik_musse, x.init = pars, method = "subplex")

# MuSSE ancestral state reconstructions under the ML model
asr_musse <- diversitree::asr.marginal(lik = lik_musse, pars = coef(fit_musse))
asr_musse
```

We obtain a (pivoted) table of probabilites linked to each state, from which we can select states as for the BioGeoBEARS example:

```{r, add_musse_asr_to_phylod}
asr_musse <- as.data.frame(t(asr_musse))
colnames(asr_musse) <- paste0(all_endemicity_status(), "_prob")

island_status <- select_endemicity_status(asr_musse, method = "max")
island_status
asr_musse$island_status <- island_status
rownames(asr_musse) <- phylobase::nodeId(phylod, "internal")

phylod <- phylobase::addData(
  phylod,
  node.data = asr_musse
)
plot_phylod(phylod)
```

From this completed tree we can extract the island clade:

```{r, extract_species_musse, warning=FALSE}
island_clades <- DAISIEprep::extract_island_species(
  phylod = phylod,
  extraction_method = "asr"
)
island_clades@island_tbl$species
island_clades@island_tbl$branching_times
```

SSE models in `diversitree` can be tuned further with constraints that
simplify the model. We can use this to make the model closer to the
assumptions of DAISIE. For example, it is not possible for a species to
jump directly to the island and disappear from the mainland
simultaneously; so that direct transitions from state 1 to 2 and back should be forbidden One could also assume mainland speciation to be unlikely, resulting in zero speciation on the mainland and the same speciation rate for endemic and nonendemic species: 

```{r, constrain_musse_lik, eval=FALSE}
lik_musse_c <- diversitree::constrain(
  lik_musse, 
  q12 ~ 0, q21 ~ 0, # no island-mainland jumps
  lambda1 ~ 0, lambda3 ~ lambda2 # no mainland speciation
)

# Parameters must be removed accordingly
pars_c <- c(
  # lambda2
  0.2,
  # mu1 mu2 mu3
  0.03, 0.03, 0.03,
  # q13 q23 q31 q32
  0, 0.02, 0, 0.01
)

fit_musse_c <- diversitree::find.mle(func = lik_musse_c, x.init = pars_c, method = "subplex")
# Won't work because of poor parameter choice vs tip states
```

The example above won't succeed because of a mismatch between the initial parameters value and the distribution of states at the tip, but we include it for illustrating how one would implement constrains on a `diversitree` model.

Instead of further constraining a multi-state model to emulate dispersal and evolution between mainland and island, one may find more appropriate to use an SSE model specifically dedicated to geographic traits, i.e., GeoSSE

## GeoSSE

GeoSSE is a special case of SSE models dedicated to the case where traits correspond to presence or absence from two geographic areas, which just happens to be the case of our mainland/island clade.
Its most important feature is that instead of considering the widespread state (mainland + island, that is nonendemic) as a third separate category from the two single-area states (as in the MuSSE example above), GeoSSE explicitly models it as corresponding to presence in both areas, just as in BioGeoBEARS.
Accordingly, dispersal is unidirectional, from a single area towards the widespread state. Extinction from an area the widespread state returns the species to the remaining single area, while the same extinction while already in a single area results in the true extinction of the species.

In fact, GeoSSE is the SSE implementation of the DEC model, the only difference being that GeoSSE assumes an effect of areas themselves on the rates of speciation and extinction; and thus on the branching patterns observed in the tree [goldberg_phylogenetic_2011], while DEC only maps geography along the branches of the tree.

We use the same tree as the previous example:

```{r, make_geosse_tree}
# Rm all data but tip states
phylod@data <- phylod@data[1]
plot_phylod(phylod)
```

GeoSSE in `diversitree` has a different state encoding than MuSSE: states are expected to be 0, 1, 2, with 0 corresponding to the widespread state (that is, present on both mainland and island, nonendemic) and the two other states corresponding to single geographic areas. Hereafter, we follow 1 = mainland/not_present and 2 = island/endemic.

The syntax is otherwise the same as for MuSSE (and other SSE models implemented in `diversitree`).

```{r, create_geosse_lik, warning=FALSE}
states <- get_sse_tip_states(phylod, sse_model = "geosse")
states # note the encoding differs from the MuSSE example

tree <- as(phylod, "phylo")

# Create likelihood function
lik_geosse <- diversitree::make.geosse(
  tree = tree, 
  states = states
)
lik_geosse
```

```{r, fit_geosse_and_asr}
# Initial GeoSSE parameter values
pars <- c(
  # Speciation: sA sB sAB
  0.2, 0.2, 0.2,
  # Extinction: xA xB
  0.02, 0.02,
  # Dispersal: dA dB
  0.1, 0
)

# Optimisation of the model's likelihood
fit_geosse <- diversitree::find.mle(func = lik_geosse, x.init = pars, method = "subplex")

# Ancestral state reconstructions under the ML model
asr_geosse <- diversitree::asr.marginal(lik = lik_geosse, pars = coef(fit_geosse))

# Select node states from marginal probabilities
asr_geosse <- as.data.frame(t(asr_geosse))
colnames(asr_geosse) <- c("nonendemic_prob", "not_present_prob", "endemic_prob") # make sure to get the order right!
island_status <- select_endemicity_status(asr_geosse, method = "max")

# Add node data to the tree
asr_geosse$island_status <- island_status
rownames(asr_geosse) <- phylobase::nodeId(phylod, "internal")
phylod <- phylobase::addData(
  phylod,
  node.data = asr_geosse
)
plot_phylod(phylod)
```

```{r, add_geosse_asr_to_phylod}

```
We are now ready to extract the island clade. In this case, the crown node is inferred as present on the island, such that the time of the colonisation event cannot be estimated from the tree:

```{r, extract_species_geosse, warning=FALSE}
island_clades <- DAISIEprep::extract_island_species(
  phylod = phylod,
  extraction_method = "asr"
)
island_clades@island_tbl$species
island_clades@island_tbl$branching_times
```

## corHMM

# require(ape)

# simmap <- makeSimmap(tree = phy, data = data, model = model, rate.cat = 1, nSim = 1,
#                      nCores = 1)
# # we import phytools plotSimmap for plotting
# phytools::plotSimmap(simmap[[1]], fsize = 0.5)

```

## Concluding remarks

Appropriate model choice depends on the clade and island system
considered? GeoHiSSE?

## Appendix

```{r, create island presence tip states, eval=FALSE}
tip_states <- c()
endemicity_status <- phylobase::tipData(phylod)$endemicity_status
for (i in seq_along(endemicity_status)) {
  if (grepl(pattern = "^not_present$", x = endemicity_status[i])) {
    tip_states[i] <- 1
  } else if (grepl(pattern = "^nonendemic$", x = endemicity_status[i])) {
    tip_states[i] <- 2
  } else if (grepl(pattern = "^endemic$", x = endemicity_status[i])) {
    tip_states[i] <- 3
  }
}
```

The maximum parsimony ancestral state reconstruction is from the R
package `castor`. The `castor` package only works with S3 `phylo`
objects, so we need to convert the phylogeny back to this type and then
run the analysis.

```{r calculate ancestral states, eval=FALSE}
phylo <- as(phylo, "phylo")
asr <- castor::asr_max_parsimony(
  tree = phylo,
  tip_states = tip_states,
  transition_costs = "sequential"
)
```

This provides us with a matrix with the probabilities of the states
(island presence/absence) at each node in the phylogeny. The first
column of the matrix is not present on the island and the second colum
of the matrix is present on the island.

```{r view ancestral state reconstruction likelihoods, eval=FALSE}
if (ncol(asr$ancestral_likelihoods) == 2) {
  colnames(asr$ancestral_likelihoods) <- c("not_present", "nonendemic")
} else if (ncol(asr$ancestral_likelihoods) == 3) {
  colnames(asr$ancestral_likelihoods) <-
    c("not_present", "nonendemic", "endemic")
}
asr$ancestral_likelihoods
```

Once we have the matrix with the likelihood of the states we can chose
the most probable state at each node using the `max.col()` function.
Here we need to make a decision that will have downstream consequences
for the DAISIE data extracted from the tree, which is when a node has
island presence and absence equally probable we need to decide whether
that species should be considered on the island. To consider it on the
island use `ties.method = "last"` in the `max.col()` function, if you
consider it not on the island use `ties.method = "first"`. For this
example we will assume that species are on the island, but for
completeness it may be worth running both and then seeing if there are
significant downstream consequences.

```{r collapse node probabilities into a single state, eval=FALSE}
node_states <- max.col(asr$ancestral_likelihoods, ties.method = "last")
```

These values can now be converted back to string to make them more
readable.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
node_states <- gsub(
  pattern = "1", replacement = "not_present", x = node_states
)
node_states <- gsub(
  pattern = "2", replacement = "nonendemic", x = node_states
)
node_states <- gsub(
  pattern = "3", replacement = "endemic", x = node_states
)
```

Now the ancestral states at the nodes is available we can combine it
into our `phylod` object.

```{r combine node data into phylod, eval=FALSE}
node_data <- data.frame(
  island_status = node_states,
  endemic_prob = asr$ancestral_likelihoods[, "endemic"],
  nonendemic_prob = asr$ancestral_likelihoods[, "nonendemic"],
  not_present_prob = asr$ancestral_likelihoods[, "not_present"],
  row.names = phylobase::nodeId(phylod, "internal")
)
phylod <- phylobase::phylo4d(
  phylo,
  tip.data = as.data.frame(endemicity_status),
  node.data = node_data
)
```
