Just R developed allow packages extend language, DAISIEprep designed allow extension ASR methods incorporation key functions (e.g. extract_island_species()). give examples three packages can used extensions: diversitree, BioGeoBEARS corHMM. diversitree (FitzJohn 2012) package containing suite State Speciation Extinction (SSE) model can reconstruct ancestral states model rates speciation, extinction transition states influence reconstruction. models prevent bias many species state high speciation model, Mk model, assumes due high transition rates state (see Maddison Knowles (2006)). example give uses MuSSE model three states (island endemic, island non-endemic present island), GeoSSE model considers presence absence two geographic areas (island mainland). SSE models diversitree can applied manner. BioGeoBEARS (Matzke 2013) widely used package includes DEC DEC+J models biogeographic reconstruction. Therefore, may people familiar models want apply extracting island colonisations DAISIE. Lastly, corHMM (Beaulieu et al. 2013) package implements hidden markov model evolution, similar Mk model, can better account rate heterogeneity introducing hidden states model. model can argued ; choice influenced taxonomic group studied.","code":"extract_island_species(phylod, extraction_method = \"min\") #> Class:  Island_tbl  #>   clade_name     status missing_species   col_time col_max_age branching_times #> 1     bird_a    endemic               0 0.09053720       FALSE              NA #> 2     bird_b    endemic               0 0.06146596       FALSE    0.016781.... #> 3     bird_d    endemic               0 0.05480904       FALSE              NA #> 4     bird_f nonendemic               0 0.58496106       FALSE              NA #>   min_age      species clade_type #> 1      NA       bird_a          1 #> 2      NA bird_b, ....          1 #> 3      NA       bird_d          1 #> 4      NA       bird_f          1 set.seed(   1,   kind = \"Mersenne-Twister\",   normal.kind = \"Inversion\",   sample.kind = \"Rejection\" ) phylo <- ape::rcoal(10)  phylo$tip.label <- c(\"bird_a\", \"bird_b\", \"bird_c\", \"bird_d\", \"bird_e\", \"bird_f\",                      \"bird_g\", \"bird_h\", \"bird_i\", \"bird_j\")  phylo <- phylobase::phylo4(phylo)  endemicity_status <- sample(   x = c(\"not_present\", \"endemic\", \"nonendemic\"),    size = length(phylobase::tipLabels(phylo)),    replace = TRUE,   prob = c(0.6, 0.2, 0.2) )  phylod <- phylobase::phylo4d(phylo, as.data.frame(endemicity_status))  # reconstruction using parsimony phylod_parsimony <- add_asr_node_states(   phylod = phylod,    asr_method = \"parsimony\")  # reconstruction using Mk model phylod_parsimony <- add_asr_node_states(   phylod = phylod,    asr_method = \"Mk\" )"},{"path":"https://joshwlambert.github.io/DAISIEprep/articles/Extending_asr.html","id":"decj","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"DEC+J","title":"Extending DAISIEprep ASR models","text":"consider following randomly generated phylogeny tip data: first example, consider popular DEC (Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis) model (Ree Smith 2008) founder-event speciation (DEC+J, Matzke (2013)), implemented R biogeobears package (Matzke 2013).

You would NOT want to just use specimens, as each specimen  #    automatically can only live in 1 area, which will typically favor DEC+J  #    models.  This is fine if the species/lineages really do live in single areas, #    but you wouldn't want to assume this without thinking about it at least.  #    In summary, you should collapse multiple specimens into species/lineages if  #    data indicates they are the same genetic population. ###################################################### path_to_biogeo <- \"../inst/extending_asr/biogeobears_ex_biogeo.txt\" write_phylip_biogeo_file(phylod, path_to_biogeo) BioGeoBEARS::getranges_from_LagrangePHYLIP(path_to_biogeo) #> An object of class \"tipranges\" #> numeric(0) #> Slot \"df\": #>        M I #> bird_a 0 1 #> bird_b 0 1 #> bird_c 0 1 #> bird_d 0 1 #> bird_e 0 1 #> bird_f 0 1 #> bird_g 1 1 #> bird_h 1 0 #> bird_i 0 1 #> bird_j 1 0 #> bird_k 1 0 #> bird_l 1 0 #> bird_m 0 1 #> bird_n 0 1 #> bird_o 0 1 #> bird_p 1 0 #> bird_q 1 0 #> bird_r 1 0 #> bird_s 1 0 #> bird_t 1 0 bgb_run$geogfn <- path_to_biogeo path_to_phylo <- \"../inst/extending_asr/biogeobears_ex_phylo.txt\" path_to_biogeo <- \"../inst/extending_asr/biogeobears_ex_biogeo.txt\" write_biogeobears_input(phylod, path_to_phylo, path_to_biogeo) #> Warning in asMethod(object): losing data while coercing phylo4d to phylo  bgb_run$trfn <- path_to_phylo bgb_run$geogfn <- path_to_biogeo bgb_run$BioGeoBEARS_model_object #> An object of class \"BioGeoBEARS_model\" #> Slot \"params_table\": #>          type    init      min      max     est                note #> d        free 0.01000  1.0e-12  5.00000 0.01000               works #> e        free 0.01000  1.0e-12  5.00000 0.01000               works #> a       fixed 0.00000  1.0e-12  5.00000 0.00000               works #> b       fixed 1.00000  1.0e-12  1.00000 1.00000 non-stratified only #> x       fixed 0.00000 -2.5e+00  2.50000 0.00000               works #> n       fixed 0.00000 -1.0e+01 10.00000 0.00000               works #> w       fixed 1.00000 -1.0e+01 10.00000 1.00000               works #> u       fixed 0.00000 -1.0e+01 10.00000 0.00000               works #> j       fixed 0.00000  1.0e-05  2.99999 0.00000               works #> ysv       3-j 2.99999  1.0e-05  3.00000 2.99999               works #> ys    ysv*2/3 1.99999  1.0e-05  2.00000 1.99999               works #> y     ysv*1/3 1.00000  1.0e-05  1.00000 1.00000               works #> s     ysv*1/3 1.00000  1.0e-05  1.00000 1.00000               works #> v     ysv*1/3 1.00000  1.0e-05  1.00000 1.00000               works #> mx01    fixed 0.00010  1.0e-04  0.99990 0.00010               works #> mx01j    mx01 0.00010  1.0e-04  0.99990 0.00010               works #> mx01y    mx01 0.00010  1.0e-04  0.99990 0.00010               works #> mx01s    mx01 0.00010  1.0e-04  0.99990 0.00010               works #> mx01v    mx01 0.00010  1.0e-04  0.99990 0.00010               works #> mx01r   fixed 0.50000  1.0e-04  0.99990 0.50000                  no #> mf      fixed 0.10000  5.0e-03  0.99500 0.10000                 yes #> dp      fixed 1.00000  5.0e-03  0.99500 1.00000                 yes #> fdp     fixed 0.00000  5.0e-03  0.99500 0.00000                 yes #>                                                                        desc #> d                         anagenesis: rate of 'dispersal' (range expansion) #> e                      anagenesis: rate of 'extinction' (range contraction) #> a           anagenesis: rate of range-switching (i.e. for a standard char.) #> b                                    anagenesis: exponent on branch lengths #> x                                   exponent on distance (modifies d, j, a) #> n                     exponent on environmental distance (modifies d, j, a) #> w               exponent on manual dispersal multipliers (modifies d, j, a) #> u            anagenesis: exponent on extinction risk with area (modifies e) #> j                 cladogenesis: relative per-event weight of jump dispersal #> ysv                                                     cladogenesis: y+s+v #> ys                                                        cladogenesis: y+s #> y       cladogenesis: relative per-event weight of sympatry (range-copying) #> s              cladogenesis: relative per-event weight of subset speciation #> v           cladogenesis: relative per-event weight of vicariant speciation #> mx01                  cladogenesis: controls range size of smaller daughter #> mx01j                 cladogenesis: controls range size of smaller daughter #> mx01y                 cladogenesis: controls range size of smaller daughter #> mx01s                 cladogenesis: controls range size of smaller daughter #> mx01v                 cladogenesis: controls range size of smaller daughter #> mx01r                       root: controls range size probabilities of root #> mf                         mean frequency of truly sampling OTU of interest #> dp                 detection probability per true sample of OTU of interest #> fdp   false detection of OTU probability per true taphonomic control sample knitr::include_graphics(\"http://phylo.wdfiles.com/local--files/biogeobears/BioGeoBEARS_supermodel.png\") #

We use a simulated phylogeny, which faciliates explaining how the data is structured.","title":"DAISIEprep Tutorial","text":"First simulate phylogeny using package ape. Important: DAISIEprep requires tip labels (taxon names) phylogeny formatted genus name species name separated underscore (e.g. “Canis_lupus”).  can also optionally tags appended species name (separated underscore, e.g. “Canis_lupus_123”; “Canis_lupus_familiaris_123”). common multiple tips phylogeny single species, multiple populations multiple subspecies sampled. Samples Genus_species name tip considered species, even subsequent sampling subspecies tags. add tip labels simulated phylogeny. case, taxa sampled different plant species genus. convert phylogeny phylo4 class defined package phylobase. allows users easily work data tip phylogeny, example whether endemic island .  Now phylogeny phylo4 format can easily append data. example, randomly simulate island endemicity status tip, assuming species equal probability island (\"not_present\"), endemic island (\"endemic\") non-endemic island (\"nonendemic\"). (real example based actual endemicity status species!). Next, can add endemicity data phylogenetic tree using phylo4d class, phylobase package. call designed phylogenetic trait data stored together. endemicity status needs converted data frame order column labelled correctly. can now visualise phylogeny island endemicity statuses plotted tips. uses ggtree ggplot2 packages.  Now can see tips present island, can extract form island community data set can used DAISIE R package fit likelihood models island colonisation diversification. extract species, first create object store island colonists’ information. uses island_tbl class introduced package (DAISIEprep). island_tbl S4 class. island_tbl object can easily converted DAISIE data list using function create_daisie_data (information ). can see object containing empty data frame. order fill data frame information island colonisation diversification events can run: function extract_island_species() main function DAISIEprep extract data phylogeny. example , used “min” extraction algorithm. “min” algorithm extracts island community data assumptions DAISIE model (.e. back-colonisation island mainland), recommend using “asr” algorithm back-colonisation events present data (example, one species within large endemic island radiation colonised another island mainland). row island_tbl corresponds separate colonisation island. case, two colonist lineages identified using ‘min’ extraction algorithm, one endemic another non-endemic. However, want use “min” algorithm, instead want extract likely colonisations inferred ancestral state reconstruction, need know probability ancestors island species island determine time colonisation. can fit one many ancestral state reconstruction methods. use maximum parsimony simple method prove reliable reconstructing ancestral species areas (.e. island island) cases. First, translate extant species endemicity status numeric representation whether species island. add one, ancestral state reconstruction method handle zero state. Now can plot phylogeny, time includes node labels presence/absence island ancestral nodes.   Sidenote: wondering probabilities node whether influence decision pick preference island mainland likelihoods state equal, can plot probabilities nodes visualise ancestral state reconstruction using plot_phylod(phylod = phylod, node_pies = TRUE).  Now can extract island colonisation diversification times phylogeny using reconstructed ancestral states island presence/absence. can see, case using asr algorithm find single colonisation island, can seen fact island_tbl one row.  Now island_tbl can convert DAISIE data list used DAISIE inference model. convert DAISIE data list ( .e. input data DAISIE inference model) use create_daisie_data(), providing island_tbl input. also need specify: age island archipelago. use island age one million years (island_age = 1). Whether colonisation times extracted phylogenetic data considered precise (precise_col_time = TRUE). discuss details , briefly setting TRUE data tell DAISIE model colonisation times known without error. Setting precise_col_time = FALSE change tell DAISIE model colonisation time uncertain interpret upper limit time colonisation integrate uncertainty point either present time first branching point (either speciation divergence subspecies). number species mainland source pool. set 100 (num_mainland_species = 100). used calculate number species potentially colonised island . refer mainland pool, necessarily continent, different island source species immigrating island largely another nearby island (possible example Madagascar source species colonising Comoros). information used DAISIE model calculate colonisation rate island. show two elements DAISIE data list produced. first element data_list[[1]] every DAISIE data list island community metadata, containing island age number species mainland pool leave descendants island present day. important information DAISIE inference, possible mainland species colonised island went extinct leaving trace island presence. Next first element containing information island colonists (every element data_list[[x]] list metadata contains information individual island colonists). contains name colonist, number missing species, branching times, vector containing age island, colonisation time times cladogenesis events. Confusingly, may branching times vector contains branching times: two numbers vector island age followed colonisation time. stac, stands status colonist. number tells DAISIE model identify endemicity colonisation uncertainty island colonist (explained interested). Lastly, type1or2 defines macroevolutionary regime island colonist . macroevolutionary regime mean set rates colonisation, speciation extinction colonist. applications assume island clades regime thus assigned type 1.
